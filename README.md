# Case Study: Top Selling Mobile Phone Analysis

## Introduction
This case study is based on the analysis of best-selling mobile phones. As a part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification, I chose this topic to explore the fascinating world of mobile phone market trends and sales patterns. This case study serves as an opportunity for me, as a beginner in R, to apply my data analytics skills to real-world data and gain valuable insights.

## Data Analysis Phases

### Ask Phase:
From the data I have chosen for analysis, we will find following insights:
- How many devices do the top 10 companies have?
-	Which are the top 10 models with the highest unit sales, along with their manufacturers?
-	which are the top 10 countries with the most brands?
-	Which regions and countries have the highest mobile phone sales?
-	What are the popular forms of mobile phones in the market?
-	How has the sales trend of mobile phones evolved over the years?

### Process Phase:
For this analysis, the data was obtained from Kaggle’s dataset [“Best Selling Mobile Phones”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammedtausif/best-selling-mobile-phones/discussion). The dataset includes information on best-selling mobile phones, mobile phone brands by country, and total phone devices by company. Moreover, the data in these datasets are current as of the year 2021. It’s important to note that the analysis is based on the information available until 2021, and any recent developments beyond that year might not be reflected in the data.

### Prepare Phase:
Before importing the data into R, some data cleaning and pre-processing were performed in [Microsoft Excel](https://github.com/Tayyaba-Abro/Google-Case-Study-Top-Selling-Mobile-Phone-Analysis). The data cleaning steps in Excel included:
-	Data Duplication: All files were checked for duplicate values.
-	Handling Missing Values: Any missing values were identified and addressed appropriately, such as filling missing data or removing incomplete records.
-	Data Format: The data format of each column was checked and corrected to ensure consistency and accuracy.
-	Data Validation: Outliers and anomalies were reviewed and verified for data accuracy.

The cleaned datasets were then saved in CSV format for further analysis in R.

#### Units Sold by Form
From the analysis of the 7 types of mobile phone forms, it was observed that the “Touchscreen” form has the largest number of units sold, accounting for the majority of sales. Additionally, the “Bar” form is also competitive, with only a slight difference of 5% fewer units sold compared to the “Touchscreen” form. The other form types show comparatively lower sales figures, with “Taco” and “Tilt Slider” forms being the least preferred by consumers.

By acting on these insights, manufacturers can optimize their product portfolios, target specific regions, and remain competitive in the dynamic global mobile phone market.

## Dashboard
The dashboard of Top Selling Mobile Phones is created on Tableau. 

![image](https://github.com/Tayyaba-Abro/Google-Case-Study-Top-Selling-Mobile-Phone-Analysis/assets/47588244/b0084f14-5358-4c0e-8ea5-73004d393496)

In this project, I've leveraged Tableau's powerful features to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Let me walk you through some of the key elements and techniques I've used to make this dashboard user-friendly and informative:

### Horizontal and Vertical Containers:
To create a clean and organized layout, I've utilized horizontal and vertical containers in Tableau. These containers help in arranging multiple sheets and components neatly on the dashboard, ensuring a seamless viewing experience. 

### Interactive Filters:
Filters play a crucial role in allowing users to interact with the data. I've incorporated interactive filters for both "Year" and "Form" to provide users with the flexibility to customize their analysis. 

### Images and Text:
To enhance the visual appeal and provide additional context, I've added relevant images of popular mobile phones on top of dashboard. These images act as visual cues and make the analysis more engaging. Additionally, I've included informative text sections to provide insights, highlight key findings, and clarify any data assumptions, such as the unit sold values being represented in millions.

### Insightful Visualizations:
Each chart and graph in the dashboard has been carefully chosen to present key insights effectively. From "Unit Sold per Year" to "Unit Sold by Region," "Unit Sold by Form," "Top 10 Models with Manufacturers," and "Top 10 Countries Dominating Sales," each visualization offers a unique perspective on the mobile phone market dynamics.

### Storytelling:
In the storytelling, cards serve as crucial signposts that guide viewers through the journey of data exploration. These cards are strategically placed within the dashboard to highlight key insights and provide context for the visualizations. Each card encapsulates a significant finding, allowing users to grasp essential information at a glance.
