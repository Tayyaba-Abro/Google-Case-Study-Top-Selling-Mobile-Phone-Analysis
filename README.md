# Google Case Study Top Selling Mobile Phone Analysis

## Introduction
This case study is based on the analysis of best-selling mobile phones. As a part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification, I chose this topic to explore the fascinating world of mobile phone market trends and sales patterns. This case study serves as an opportunity for me, as a beginner in R, to apply my data analytics skills to real-world data and gain valuable insights.

## Data Analysis Phases

### Ask Phase:
From the data I have chosen for analysis, we will find following insights:
- How many devices do the top 10 companies have?
-	Which are the top 10 models with the highest unit sales, along with their manufacturers?
-	which are the top 10 countries with the most brands?
-	Which regions and countries have the highest mobile phone sales?
-	What are the popular forms of mobile phones in the market?
-	How has the sales trend of mobile phones evolved over the years?

## Process Phase:
For this analysis, the data was obtained from Kaggle’s dataset “Best Selling Mobile Phones”. The dataset includes information on best-selling mobile phones, mobile phone brands by country, and total phone devices by company. Moreover, the data in these datasets are current as of the year 2021. It’s important to note that the analysis is based on the information available until 2021, and any recent developments beyond that year might not be reflected in the data.

## Prepare Phase:
Before importing the data into R, some data cleaning and pre-processing were performed in Microsoft Excel. The data cleaning steps in Excel included:
-	Data Duplication: All files were checked for duplicate values.
-	Handling Missing Values: Any missing values were identified and addressed appropriately, such as filling missing data or removing incomplete records.
-	Data Format: The data format of each column was checked and corrected to ensure consistency and accuracy.
-	Data Validation: Outliers and anomalies were reviewed and verified for data accuracy.

The cleaned datasets were then saved in CSV format for further analysis in R.
